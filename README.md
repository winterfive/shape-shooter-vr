# shape-shooter-vr :large_blue_circle::large_orange_diamond::large_blue_circle::large_orange_diamond::large_blue_circle::large_orange_diamond::large_blue_circle::large_orange_diamond:

This is the first VR app I created using Unity, C# and applying the C# event system.  It can be played on the GearVR.

You begin in a room where instances of cubes and spheres begin to rain down around you, bouncing like 25 cent rubber balls due to the physics materials applied.  These 3d shapes spawn at a steady pace from three positions at random.  Your goal is to shoot the shapes, with help of your VR GUI reticle and the realtime shadows to help you guage distance.  Your score is always available to you as it's displayed on a large panel on the left side of the room.  There's an energetic looping audio track and an explosion effect, visual and audio, when you dispatch a shape.  

NOTE: I created this as a foundation for my next app, hover-shooter.  Visit the repo at: https://github.com/winterfive/hover-shooter
