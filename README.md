# shape-shooter-vr :large_blue_circle::large_orange_diamond::large_blue_circle::large_orange_diamond::large_blue_circle::large_orange_diamond::large_blue_circle::large_orange_diamond:

This is the first VR app I created using Unity, C#, Visual Studio.  It can be played on the GearVR.

You begin in a room where instances of cubes and spheres begin to rain down around you, bouncing like 25 cent rubber balls due to the physics materials applied.  These 3d shapes spawn at a steady pace from three different positions.  Your goal is to shoot the shapes, with help of your VR GUI reticle and the realtime shadows to help you gauge distance.  Your score is always available to you as it's displayed on a large panel on the left side of the room.  There's an energetic looping audio track and an explosion effect, visual and audio, when you dispatch a shape.

The code is optimized using OOP principles and the C# event system.

I created this as a foundation for my next app, an as yet unnamed GearVR game.
